Here lies the code for generating the Adelaide Perl Mongers web site!

It contains:

* some perl libs for dealing with meeting dates (in lib/)
* some template files for generating the web site (in web/)
* some (primitive) tests (in t/)
* some scripts to tie it all together (bin/)

To build the website do:

$ chdir web
$ ttree --EVAL_PERL -f lib/site.cfg -a --verbose
